  "gemini-2.0-flash-thinking_translation": "<translation>By this description, it is said that the body of Kana was a very slender body, and a large and very flexible body to look at. When he was a child, his body was like a lei, and his house of Halauoloolo was also like a lei; from the mountain to the sea, his body was like a lei, and the appearance of the house, Halauoloolo, was the same.</translation>",
  "reference_translation": "In this legend it is said that the body of Kana grew to be very tall and large and was terrible to behold. While he was being brought up, he grew so fast that the house had to be lengthened, so that it extended from the mountain until it was almost to the edge of the sea. Such is the story as told of this house, Halauoloolo."
