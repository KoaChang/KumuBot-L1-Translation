  "gemini-2.0-flash-thinking_translation": "<translation>At the time of twilight, the spirit of Pumaia again approached the woman. This was the reason he was able to come. The mother looked at her daughter and said, \"You, our child, are the beloved of the people with red blood, not of those without red blood, the people of no importance.\" Pumaia said, \"What are you two whispering about?\" \"Nothing, we were just talking about death, and that you are not of the people without red blood.\" Then Pumaia said to the woman, \"Let us go; I will take you and carry you.\" They set out from Pukoula and passed by the spring of Pauoa, and went on until they reached the water of Alekoki, at Maemae, where they rested and spent the night, and at dawn they continued on and reached Nuuanu.</translation>",
  "reference_translation": "On the second night, the spirit of Pumaia again came to the wife. The reason for this coming was this: The wife that day looked at her daughter and said: “Yes, I am grieving at our fate as our bones still need blood, not your father as his bones have no blood.” At this Pumaia’s spirit asked: “What are you two talking low about?” The wife replied: “Nothing, we are just talking about death, not of you of the bloodless bones.” Pumaia’s spirit then spoke to the wife: “Let us get away from this place. Take me out and take me along.” After the body had been dug up, they left Pukoula and walked toward the mountains along the road leading to the junction of Pauoa and the road that leads to the Alekoki pool. They then continued on up toward Maemae, and by dawn of [the next day] they reached Nuuanu."
