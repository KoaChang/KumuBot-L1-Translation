One said to the other: \"Hey, maybe this is the daughter of the chief, Laukiamanuikahiki.\" The other said: \"No, it is not; she has a red canoe, a red sail, a red paddle, a red person, a large canoe, a small canoe, a long canoe, a large person, a small person, that is her nature when she comes, this is not a poor girl.\" They listened again to the words of the owl and Laukiamanuikahiki. \"Let us go up and speak to the chief, perhaps this is the daughter.\" One agreed. \"Yes.\" They reached Makiioeoe the chief, at midnight, and woke him up: \"Hey there, wake up.\" \"What?\" said Makiioeoe. \"An owl, it is right above the place where the girl is held.
