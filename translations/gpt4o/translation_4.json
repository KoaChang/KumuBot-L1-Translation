  "gpt4o_translation": "<translation>In the middle of the night, the spirit of Pumaia returned to the woman. However, this was the reason for its return. The mother looked at the daughter and said: \"U, we are indeed the beloved of the same blood, not of your father who is not of the same blood.\" Pumaia said: \"What are you two whispering about?\" \"Nothing, we are just talking about death, not about you who are not of the same blood.\" Pumaia said to the woman: \"Let us go; release me and take me with you.\" They ascended from Pukoula to the ridge of Pauoa, traveling until they reached the waters of Alekoki, from there to Maemae, and thus they climbed until the break of dawn, reaching Nuuanu.</translation>",
  "reference_translation": "On the second night, the spirit of Pumaia again came to the wife. The reason for this coming was this: The wife that day looked at her daughter and said: “Yes, I am grieving at our fate as our bones still need blood, not your father as his bones have no blood.” At this Pumaia’s spirit asked: “What are you two talking low about?” The wife replied: “Nothing, we are just talking about death, not of you of the bloodless bones.” Pumaia’s spirit then spoke to the wife: “Let us get away from this place. Take me out and take me along.” After the body had been dug up, they left Pukoula and walked toward the mountains along the road leading to the junction of Pauoa and the road that leads to the Alekoki pool. They then continued on up toward Maemae, and by dawn of [the next day] they reached Nuuanu."
