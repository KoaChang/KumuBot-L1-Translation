It is a canoe. If the cloth is folded as an outrigger boom, placed into the container, is it not an outrigger boom? It is an outrigger boom. If the fish is caught and an outrigger float is obtained, placed into the container, is it not an outrigger float? It is an outrigger float.\"</translation>",
  "reference_translation": "The men then replied: “You are mistaken, young man. How can a canoe get into a calabash with its iako and outrigger?” The boy answered: “The kapa cloth made from the kiwaawaa is first beaten and then put into the calabash. The word (waa) canoe is there, is it not? I think it is. The kapa of iako is also beaten and then put into the calabash. Is not the iako then put into the calabash? I believe it is. The fisherman goes out and catches an ama and puts it into the calabash. Is not that an ama (outrigger)? I think it is.”"
