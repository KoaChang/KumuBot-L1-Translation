Wailea also has a younger sibling, Kalenaihaleauau, the wife of Kukuipahu, the chief of Kohala. Kaipalaoa was born and grew up, and his father went to Kauai, where he died at the hands of Kalanialiiloa, a sacred chief of Kauai, a chief skilled in riddles, who had broken the bones of people, Halepaiwi, with only a small part remaining completely unbroken of the human bones. Halepaki was indeed knowledgeable in riddles, he was taught, but he did not complete the initiation, and he went to Kauai and died at the hands of Kalanialiiloa. Pueonuiokona is the chief of Kauai.</translation>",
  "reference_translation": "Kaipalaoa was born in Waiakea, Hilo. His father was Halepaki and his mother was Wailea the sister of Kalenaihaleauau, the wife of Kukuipahu, the king of Kohala. After Kaipalaoa was grown up his father went off to Kauai where he was killed by Kalanialiiloa, a kapu chief of Kauai. This chief was in the front rank of those who took up the profession of hoopapa, who by reason of his great skill had his house enclosed in a fence of bones. This fence was almost completed and every bone in it had come from those he had defeated in the profession."
