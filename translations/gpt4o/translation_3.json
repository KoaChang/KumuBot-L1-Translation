  "gpt4o_translation": "<translation>On the second day of their stay in Hilo, Keawenuiaumi and Mainele went to the place of the koa tree for canoe building, and the birds called out, carrying the bundle of tools. When they arrived beneath the trunk of this koa tree, Kauakahi sat apart with the bundle of tools. At that time, the canoe builders of Keawenuiaumi cut the trunk of the koa, and the birds perched, calling out: “Oh, Keawenuiaumi! There is no canoe, it is a hollow log. A bad canoe, a hollow canoe. A canoe that cannot reach the ocean.”</translation>",
  "reference_translation": "On the second day of their arrival at Hilo, Keawenuiaumi, Mainele and the people proceeded up into the koa forest where the tree that had been already picked out was situated. On this trip the basket was carried along, and when they arrived at the tree, Kauakahi and his basket remained at a little distance from the others. The king’s canoe makers then proceeded to cut down the tree. Just as soon as this was done the birds lit on the tree and called out: “Say, Keawenuiaumi! You cannot make a canoe [out of this tree], it is hollow. It is a worthless canoe, a hollow canoe. A canoe that will never reach the ocean.”"
