  "gpt-4o-mini-finetuned_translation": "Makiioeoe was the son of the chief Makiioeoe and Hina was his mother (Kuaihelani was the name of Makiioeoe’s father’s land, and the woman that lived there with him was the chiefess, and she was the mother of one son, Kahikiula). Hina was a native of Kauai, where Laukiamanuikahiki was obtained. After Makiioeoe had come from Kuaihelani and got Hina at Kauai, they were married, and Hina afterwards became pregnant. After Makiioeoe had returned to Kuaihelani he said to Hina: “I am going back; you must remain here and if you give birth to a son you shall name him after me; but if a daughter, she shall be called Laukiamanuikahiki. If you bring up the child to maturity and think of coming to look for me, here are some tokens, a whale’s tooth, a pair of sandals, a feather cloak, a large canoe, a small canoe, a man of rank, and a common man, a red canoe, a red cord, a red cloth, and a red man, and a red woman.” After Makiioeoe returned to Kuaihelani he told the keepers of the place that a girl had been born and that they should plant all the things that he had sent for Laukiamanuikahiki, and that the water and food of every kind should be made sacred to her.",
  "reference_translation": "Makiioeoe was the father and Hina was the mother of Laukiamanuikahiki. Kuaihelani was the home of Makiioeoe where he ruled as king and where his queen lived from whom he had one child, Kahikiula by name. Hina belonged to Kauai, where Laukiamanuikahiki was born. Makiioeoe in his travels came to Kauai where he met Hina and took her to wife, and after living with her for some time, Hina conceived a child. Shortly after this Makiioeoe prepared to return to Kuaihelani; so he said to Hina: “I am going home. If you should give birth to a boy give him my name; but in case it should be a girl call her Laukiamanuikahiki. If after you bring the child up she should express a desire to come in search of me, these shall be the tokens by which I shall recognize the child: this necklace of whale’s teeth, this bracelet, this feather cloak. She must be accompanied by a large canoe, a small canoe, large men, small men, a red canoe, red sails, red bailing cup, red cords and a red man.” Makiioeoe then took his leave and returned to Kuaihelani. When he arrived home he instructed his guards as to the sign by which to recognize his daughter and he also instructed his servants to proceed and plant all kinds of fruit and other things for his daughter Laukiamanuikahiki. He also caused a pool of water to be made as well as other things and placed a kapu on them all to be free only after the same shall have been used by Laukiamanuikahiki."
