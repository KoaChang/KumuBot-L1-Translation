  "gpt-4o-mini-finetuned_translation": "After a long fasting period Pikoiakaalala disappeared from the congregation of people and returned home to his sisters, where he was fed on pig and other food. Before the meal was partaken of, Pikoiakaalala said: “Listen to me all of you, I have a law for the eating of food, as follows: ‘No one shall speak, no one shall whisper, no one shall bend forward, no one shall inhale, no one shall make a noise of any kind during the time of my eating.’” He then took up the pig and killed it, then cooked the sweet potatoes, and after that he took up the second step of the eating process, that is, he took a drink of water, and again he took up the third step, which was to eat up the whole pig and all the food that was in the oven. One of the men present said: “Food for the gods.” The first born of the family of the women: “What is the food for the gods cut with?” “With a knife.” “What is the food for the gods cooked in?” “In a pot.” “What is the food for the gods eaten with?” “With the fingers.” “What is the food for the gods drank with?” “With the mouth.” “What is the noise made when the food for the gods is swallowed?” “None, it is swallowed without noise.” “Yes, we have heard that your law for the eating of food.” In the eating of this food by Pikoiakaalala his body grew larger and larger until he became a man of great size and beauty, but his hair was that of a dog.",
  "reference_translation": "As Pikoiakaalala was very hungry he disappeared from the people who had gathered at this place and returned to his sisters, where he found the pig and food cooked. Before he sat down to eat Pikoiakaalala addressed the people, saying: “I want you all to understand that I have certain rules in connection with my meals. There must be no talking, no whispering, no nodding, no pinching and no noise of any kind should be heard until I finish my meal.” He then reached for a piece of pork and a dish of potato, taking one bite of each which he swallowed; he then reached for another piece of pork, almost finishing the pig, and all the food of the oven. At this one of the men remarked: “He eats like a god.” On hearing this Pikoiakaalala stopped eating. His brothers-in-law then said: “Why don’t you go on eating?” “No, I have had enough.” “Yes, we already heard your rule,” said his brother-in-law. In this one meal partaken by Pikoiakaalala, he grew into a large and fine looking man, but his hair was [like] rat’s hair."
