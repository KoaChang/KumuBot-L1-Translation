  "gpt-4o-mini-finetuned_translation": "Kalelealuaka and Keinohoomanawanui, on their way to the outside of the house in the early morning, saw that a spear was standing at the door of the house. Keinohoomanawanui said to Kalelealuaka: “Let us kill ourselves! Here is a spear at the door of our house. It is evident that we are in great danger; our lives are sought, for I am no longer speaking of you, but of the chief, that is, that you should be prepared for death.”",
  "reference_translation": "When Kalelealuaka and Keinohoomanawanui woke up in the morning and went out of doors, they saw a wooden dagger sticking in the ground just outside of the entrance. At seeing this Keinohoomanawanui said to Kalelealuaka: “We are going to be killed. Here is a wooden dagger at our door. We have been discovered. What a pity that we are to be killed. You can now see the consequences of disobeying my advice, not to speak anything in connection with the king.”"
