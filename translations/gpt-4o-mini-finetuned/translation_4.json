The mother saw that the daughter was in a trance and she spoke to her: “O, our dear one, the life blood of our family, do not forget that your father is without the life blood of the family.” Pumaia replied: “What are you two murmuring about?” The mother replied: “We are only talking about our death, for without you our lives would be of no value.” Pumaia then said to the woman: “Let us go; I will be killed and we will die together.” They then ascended the mountain Pukoula to the temple of Pauoa, where they stayed until the water of Alekoki was reached, and from there to Maemae, where they again ascended to the summit of the Kaiaka sea in the early morning of the third day, arriving at Nuuanu.",
  "reference_translation": "On the second night, the spirit of Pumaia again came to the wife. The reason for this coming was this: The wife that day looked at her daughter and said: “Yes, I am grieving at our fate as our bones still need blood, not your father as his bones have no blood.” At this Pumaia’s spirit asked: “What are you two talking low about?” The wife replied: “Nothing, we are just talking about death, not of you of the bloodless bones.” Pumaia’s spirit then spoke to the wife: “Let us get away from this place. Take me out and take me along.” After the body had been dug up, they left Pukoula and walked toward the mountains along the road leading to the junction of Pauoa and the road that leads to the Alekoki pool. They then continued on up toward Maemae, and by dawn of [the next day] they reached Nuuanu."
