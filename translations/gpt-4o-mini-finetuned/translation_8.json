  "gpt-4o-mini-finetuned_translation": "The grown people said: “Boy, you are talking nonsense; all the parts of a canoe are packed in a box, and the box is lifted with the help of the thwarts, isn’t it?” The boy replied: “The sides of the box are braced with cross pieces, and the box is lifted with the help of the thwarts, but that does not prove that it is a canoe. It is a canoe. The covering of the box and the sides are fastened together, and the box is lifted with the help of the handles, but that does not prove that they are handles. They are handles. The fish is large enough to be put in the box, and the box is lifted with the help of the thongs, but that does not prove that it is a box. It is a box.”",
  "reference_translation": "The men then replied: “You are mistaken, young man. How can a canoe get into a calabash with its iako and outrigger?” The boy answered: “The kapa cloth made from the kiwaawaa is first beaten and then put into the calabash. The word (waa) canoe is there, is it not? I think it is. The kapa of iako is also beaten and then put into the calabash. Is not the iako then put into the calabash? I believe it is. The fisherman goes out and catches an ama and puts it into the calabash. Is not that an ama (outrigger)? I think it is.”"
