  "gpt-4o-mini-finetuned_translation": "Waiakea of Hilo was the son of Halepaki and Wailea. Wailea had a sister, Kalenaihaleauau, who was the wife of Kukuipahu, a chief of Kohala. Wailea bore Kaipalaoa and many other children. Their father, Halepaki, went to Kauai and killed Kalanialiiloa, a kapu chief of Kauai, and a man of great ability, who had the power of hypnotism, by which he could put people to sleep. He also had the power of making people’s bones become rigid. Halepaki knew that Kalanialiiloa was to be put to death, but he was not sure of the time, so he went to Kauai and stayed until Kalanialiiloa was killed. Pueonuiokona was the king of Kauai at that time.",
  "reference_translation": "Kaipalaoa was born in Waiakea, Hilo. His father was Halepaki and his mother was Wailea the sister of Kalenaihaleauau, the wife of Kukuipahu, the king of Kohala. After Kaipalaoa was grown up his father went off to Kauai where he was killed by Kalanialiiloa, a kapu chief of Kauai. This chief was in the front rank of those who took up the profession of hoopapa, who by reason of his great skill had his house enclosed in a fence of bones. This fence was almost completed and every bone in it had come from those he had defeated in the profession."
