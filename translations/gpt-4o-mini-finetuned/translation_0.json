  "gpt-4o-mini-finetuned_translation": "In this account it is stated that the body of Kana was long and very large and fearful to look upon. When he was being fed his body would stretch to an enormous length, and so would the house of Halauoloolo; for his body would reach from the mountain to near the sea and so on up to the building of the house of Halauoloolo.",
  "reference_translation": "In this legend it is said that the body of Kana grew to be very tall and large and was terrible to behold. While he was being brought up, he grew so fast that the house had to be lengthened, so that it extended from the mountain until it was almost to the edge of the sea. Such is the story as told of this house, Halauoloolo."
