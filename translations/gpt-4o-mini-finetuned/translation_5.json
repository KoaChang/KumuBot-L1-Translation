They said to each other: “This is probably the girl that the chief, Laukiamanuikahiki, is in search of.” One of them said: “No; this is not she; for his canoe is a red one, and the sails and paddles are red, and the crew are red men. His canoe is large, mine is small; his is long, mine short; his crew are men of stature, mine are little men; that is the kind of person that is coming, but this girl is of low degree.” They again listened to the conversation between the owl and Laukiamanuikahiki.

This is what the owl said, and this is what we heard the girl called.”",

After a while they agreed to go up and tell the king of the possibility of this girl being his daughter. They arrived at the home of Makiioeoe after midnight and roused him up saying: “Say, you wake up.” “What is it?” said Makiioeoe. “There is an owl right over the pig house where the girl is held who called out to the girl in the following way:"
