  "gpt-4o-mini-finetuned_translation": "On the second day of the sun they reached Hilo, where Keawenuiaumi and Mainele hired a canoe of the people, and a man to steer it, with the understanding that they were to be taken to the foot of the koa tree. When they arrived at the foot of the tree, Kauakahi and the hokeo ie were set apart from the rest of the company. At this time the canoe builders of Keawenuiaumi began to cut down the koa tree. After the tree was cut down the men climbed up and fastened the ropes around it, and then called out: “O, Keawenuiaumi! There is no canoe, only a raft. This is a bad kind of a canoe, a raft. This kind of a canoe cannot live on the ocean.”",
  "reference_translation": "On the second day of their arrival at Hilo, Keawenuiaumi, Mainele and the people proceeded up into the koa forest where the tree that had been already picked out was situated. On this trip the basket was carried along, and when they arrived at the tree, Kauakahi and his basket remained at a little distance from the others. The king’s canoe makers then proceeded to cut down the tree. Just as soon as this was done the birds lit on the tree and called out: “Say, Keawenuiaumi! You cannot make a canoe [out of this tree], it is hollow. It is a worthless canoe, a hollow canoe. A canoe that will never reach the ocean.”"
