  "o1_translation": "<translation>\nOn the second night, the spirit of Pumaia again appeared to the woman. This is why he was able to come: The mother looked at the daughter and said, “Oh, we two are truly bound by the same blood, unlike your father who does not share our lineage.” Then Pumaia said, “What are you two whispering about?” They replied, “It is nothing; we were only talking about death—that you are not of the same blood.” Pumaia then said to the woman, “Let us go; set me free and take me with you.” So they traveled uphill from Pukoula to the crossing at Pauoa, continued on until they reached the waters of Alekoki, and from there on to Maemae. Thus they climbed, and at the first light of early morning, they arrived at Nuuanu.\n</translation>",
  "reference_translation": "On the second night, the spirit of Pumaia again came to the wife. The reason for this coming was this: The wife that day looked at her daughter and said: “Yes, I am grieving at our fate as our bones still need blood, not your father as his bones have no blood.” At this Pumaia’s spirit asked: “What are you two talking low about?” The wife replied: “Nothing, we are just talking about death, not of you of the bloodless bones.” Pumaia’s spirit then spoke to the wife: “Let us get away from this place. Take me out and take me along.” After the body had been dug up, they left Pukoula and walked toward the mountains along the road leading to the junction of Pauoa and the road that leads to the Alekoki pool. They then continued on up toward Maemae, and by dawn of [the next day] they reached Nuuanu."
