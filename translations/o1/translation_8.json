  "o1_translation": "<translation>\nThe elders said: “You lying child; you say the canoe is all inside the container—outrigger boom and float included?” \nThe child answered: “If you beat bark cloth into the shape of a canoe and put it into the container, isn’t that a canoe? It is a canoe. If you beat bark cloth into an outrigger boom and put it into the container, isn’t that an outrigger boom? It is an outrigger boom. If you go fishing and acquire a float, then put it into the container, isn’t that a float? It is a float.”\n</translation>",
  "reference_translation": "The men then replied: “You are mistaken, young man. How can a canoe get into a calabash with its iako and outrigger?” The boy answered: “The kapa cloth made from the kiwaawaa is first beaten and then put into the calabash. The word (waa) canoe is there, is it not? I think it is. The kapa of iako is also beaten and then put into the calabash. Is not the iako then put into the calabash? I believe it is. The fisherman goes out and catches an ama and puts it into the calabash. Is not that an ama (outrigger)? I think it is.”"
