  "o1_translation": "<translation>In this legend, it is said that Kana’s body was extraordinarily long—large and fearsome to behold. While he was being raised, his body stretched in length, and so did his house, Halauoloolo. From the mountain to nearly the sea was the span of his body, and thus it was as well for the house, Halauoloolo.</translation>",
  "reference_translation": "In this legend it is said that the body of Kana grew to be very tall and large and was terrible to behold. While he was being brought up, he grew so fast that the house had to be lengthened, so that it extended from the mountain until it was almost to the edge of the sea. Such is the story as told of this house, Halauoloolo."
