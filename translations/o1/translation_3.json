  "o1_translation": "<translation>\nOn the second day of their stay in Hilo, Keawenuiaumi and Mainele went up to the koa tree for canoe building, guided by the calls of the birds, carrying the ‘ie container on a pole. When they reached the base of that koa tree, Kauakahi remained apart with the ‘ie container. At that time, Keawenuiaumi’s canoe carvers cut the trunk of the koa. The birds landed and cried out, “Hey, Keawenuiaumi! That’s no canoe—it’s defective. A bad canoe, a worthless canoe. A canoe that cannot go to sea.”\n</translation>",
  "reference_translation": "On the second day of their arrival at Hilo, Keawenuiaumi, Mainele and the people proceeded up into the koa forest where the tree that had been already picked out was situated. On this trip the basket was carried along, and when they arrived at the tree, Kauakahi and his basket remained at a little distance from the others. The king’s canoe makers then proceeded to cut down the tree. Just as soon as this was done the birds lit on the tree and called out: “Say, Keawenuiaumi! You cannot make a canoe [out of this tree], it is hollow. It is a worthless canoe, a hollow canoe. A canoe that will never reach the ocean.”"
