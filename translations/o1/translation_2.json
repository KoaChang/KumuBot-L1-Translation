Then Keinohoomanawanui said to Kalelealuaka: “We are going to die! There is a dagger at the door of our house—we have been discovered. Alas for us, it means death! I was telling you we should leave the chief alone, so that there would be no talk of death.”</translation>",
  "reference_translation": "When Kalelealuaka and Keinohoomanawanui woke up in the morning and went out of doors, they saw a wooden dagger sticking in the ground just outside of the entrance. At seeing this Keinohoomanawanui said to Kalelealuaka: “We are going to be killed. Here is a wooden dagger at our door. We have been discovered. What a pity that we are to be killed. You can now see the consequences of disobeying my advice, not to speak anything in connection with the king.”"
