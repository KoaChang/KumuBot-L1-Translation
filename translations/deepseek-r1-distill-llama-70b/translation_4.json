  "deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b_translation": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to translate this Hawaiian text into English. First, I'll read through the text to get a sense of the overall meaning. It seems to be a narrative, maybe a story or a legend. I notice some recurring words like \"ka,\" \"o,\" and \"i,\" which are common in Hawaiian as articles and prepositions.\n\nI'll start by breaking down each sentence. The first sentence: \"I ka lua o ka po, hiki hou ka uhane o Pumaia i ka wahine.\" I know \"i\" is a preposition, \"ka\" is the article, \"lua\" might mean night or darkness, \"po\" is night. So \"I ka lua o ka po\" could be \"In the depths of the night.\" \"Hiki hou\" probably means \"returns\" or \"comes again.\" \"Uhane\" is spirit, so \"ka uhane o Pumaia\" is \"the spirit of Pumaia.\" \"I ka wahine\" means \"to the woman.\" So the first part is \"In the depths of the night, the spirit of Pumaia returns to the woman.\"\n\nNext sentence: \"Eia nae ke kumu i hiki ai.\" \"Eia\" is here, \"nae\" is an emphatic particle, \"ke kumu\" is the reason or cause, \"i hiki ai\" is that it arrives or comes. So maybe \"Here is the reason why it comes.\"\n\nThen, \"Nana aku la ka makuahine i ke kaikamahine a pane aku.\" \"Nana aku\" is looking or gazing, \"ka makuahine\" is the mother, \"i ke kaikamahine\" is at the daughter, \"a pane aku.\" \"Pane\" can mean to speak or tell, so \"a pane aku\" is \"and speaks.\" So the mother looks at the daughter and speaks.\n\nThe mother says: “U, o kaua ka hoi ka mea aloha o ka iwi koko, aole o ko makuakane o ka iwi koko ole.” \"U\" is an interjection, maybe \"Ah\" or \"Oh.\" \"O kaua ka hoi\" could be \"We are the ones.\" \"Ka mea aloha\" is the loved one or beloved. \"O ka iwi koko\" is of the blood or lineage. \"Aole\" is no or not. \"O ko makuakane\" is your father's. \"O ka iwi koko ole\" is without blood or lineage. So the mother is saying, \"Ah, we are the beloved ones of the blood, not your father who is without blood.\"\n\nPumaia responds: “Heaha ka olua e hamumu nei?” \"Heaha\" is why, \"ka olua\" is your duo or you two, \"e hamumu nei\" is doing or plotting. So Pumaia asks, \"Why are you two scheming?\"\n\nThe woman replies: “Aole, e mea wale ae ana no maua i ka make, aole ou o ka iwi koko ole.” \"Aole\" is no, \"e mea wale ae ana\" is just coming for death, \"no maua\" is for us, \"aole ou\" is not your, \"o ka iwi koko ole\" is of the bloodless lineage. So she says, \"No, we are just coming for death, not you of the bloodless lineage.\"\n\nPumaia then says: “E hele kakou; e wehe ia’u a lawe pu.” \"E hele\" is let's go, \"kakou\" is we (inclusive). \"E wehe\" is to separate or part, \"ia’u\" is me, \"a lawe pu\" is and take. So Pumaia says, \"Let's go; part from me and take.\"\n\nThen they leave from Pukoula to the uakee of Pauoa, go to Alekoki water, where Maemae is, and they climb to the seaward cliff at dawn, arriving at Nuuanu. I'll need to make sure the place names are correctly translated or kept as is if they don't have direct English equivalents.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll ensure the translation flows naturally in English while preserving the original meaning and cultural context. I'll also check for any idiomatic expressions that might not translate directly and adjust accordingly.\n</think>\n\n<translation>\nIn the depths of the night, the spirit of Pumaia returns to the woman. Here is the reason why it comes. The mother looks at the daughter and speaks: \"Ah, we are the beloved ones of the blood, not your father who is without blood.\" Pumaia asks, \"Why are you two scheming?\" The woman replies, \"No, we are\"</translation>",
  "reference_translation": "On the second night, the spirit of Pumaia again came to the wife. The reason for this coming was this: The wife that day looked at her daughter and said: “Yes, I am grieving at our fate as our bones still need blood, not your father as his bones have no blood.” At this Pumaia’s spirit asked: “What are you two talking low about?” The wife replied: “Nothing, we are just talking about death, not of you of the bloodless bones.” Pumaia’s spirit then spoke to the wife: “Let us get away from this place. Take me out and take me along.” After the body had been dug up, they left Pukoula and walked toward the mountains along the road leading to the junction of Pauoa and the road that leads to the Alekoki pool. They then continued on up toward Maemae, and by dawn of [the next day] they reached Nuuanu."
