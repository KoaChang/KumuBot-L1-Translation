  "deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b_translation": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to translate this Hawaiian text into English. First, I'll read through the text to get a sense of the story. It seems to be about someone named Pikoiakaalala and some events involving a pig and food. \n\nI'll start by breaking down each sentence. The first sentence: \"No ka pololi loa o Pikoiakaalala nalo aku la ia mai ke anaina kanaka aku, hoi aku la ia a hiki i kona mau kaikuahine, ua moa ka puaa a me ka ai.\" I think \"pololi\" might mean \"belly\" or \"stomach,\" so \"No ka pololi loa\" could be \"Concerning the large belly of Pikoiakaalala.\" Then, \"nalo aku la ia mai ke anaina kanaka aku\" might mean he went to the land or to some place. \"Hoi aku la ia a hiki i kona mau kaikuahine\" seems like he returned to his sisters. \"Ua moa ka puaa a me ka ai\" probably means the pig and the food were cooked.\n\nNext sentence: \"Mamua o ka paina ana, pane aku o Pikoiakaalala: “E hoolohe mai oukou a pau loa, he wahi kanawai ko’u no ka ai ana, penei: “Aohe walaau, aohe hawanawana, aohe kunou, aohe iniki, aohe hamumu, a pau kuu paina ana.”\" So before eating, Pikoiakaalala says to listen, stating his rules for eating: no talking, no sharing, no hesitation, no greed, no murmuring, and that's all his rules.\n\nThen, \"Lalau aku la ia i ka puaa, hookahi kaka, o ke poi uala, hookahi nau ana, a moni, lalau hou, kokoke e pau ka puaa okoa, a me ka ai a pau o ka umu.\" He serves the pig, one piece each, some poi, one portion each, and then serves again until the pig and all the food are finished.\n\nSomeone says, \"He ai na ke Akua,\" which I think means \"The food is from Akua (God).\" Then, \"Oki iho la keia.\" Maybe \"This was ended or finished.\" The priest asks if it's okay to eat, and Pikoiakaalala says no because he's full. The priest mentions hearing his rules, and Pikoiakaalala's body becomes large and good, but his hair is bad.\n\nI need to make sure the translation is accurate and flows well in English. I'll check each word and structure to ensure the meaning is preserved. Also, I'll use the <translation> tags as instructed.\n</think>\n\n<translation>Concerning the large belly of Pikoiakaalala, he went to the land of the people, then returned to his sisters, and the pig and the food were cooked. Before eating, Pikoiakaalala said, \"Listen everyone, these are my rules for eating: no talking, no sharing, no hesitation, no greed, no murmuring, and that's all my rules.\" He served the pig, one piece each, some poi, one portion each, and served again until the pig and all the food were finished. Someone said, \"The food is from God.\" This was ended. The priest asked if it was okay to eat, and Pikoiakaalala replied he was full. The priest acknowledged hearing his rules. During this meal, Pikoiakaalala's body became large and strong, though his hair remained bad.</translation>",
  "reference_translation": "As Pikoiakaalala was very hungry he disappeared from the people who had gathered at this place and returned to his sisters, where he found the pig and food cooked. Before he sat down to eat Pikoiakaalala addressed the people, saying: “I want you all to understand that I have certain rules in connection with my meals. There must be no talking, no whispering, no nodding, no pinching and no noise of any kind should be heard until I finish my meal.” He then reached for a piece of pork and a dish of potato, taking one bite of each which he swallowed; he then reached for another piece of pork, almost finishing the pig, and all the food of the oven. At this one of the men remarked: “He eats like a god.” On hearing this Pikoiakaalala stopped eating. His brothers-in-law then said: “Why don’t you go on eating?” “No, I have had enough.” “Yes, we already heard your rule,” said his brother-in-law. In this one meal partaken by Pikoiakaalala, he grew into a large and fine looking man, but his hair was [like] rat’s hair."
