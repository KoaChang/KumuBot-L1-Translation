  "deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b_translation": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to translate this Hawaiian text into English. First, I'll read through the text to get a sense of the overall meaning. It seems to be a narrative about two characters, Kalelealuaka and Keinohoomanawanui, who go outside in the morning and find a pahoa (which I think is a type of fish) at their door. Keinohoomanawanui is telling Kalelealuaka not to go out because there's a pahoa there, and they don't want to die. He mentions that he's the one who told him to avoid death.\n\nI'll start by breaking down the sentences. The first part is \"O Kalelealuaka a me Keinohoomanawanui, i ko laua ala ana i ke kakahiaka a hele iwaho o ka hale, iko iho la laua he pahoa e ku ana ma ka puka o ka hale, ua kukuluia.\" This introduces the two characters and their actions in the morning. \"O\" is like \"and\" here. \"I ko laua ala ana\" means when they got up. \"Ke kakahiaka\" is morning. \"Hele iwaho o ka hale\" is going outside the house. \"Iko iho la laua\" is when they went down. \"He pahoa e ku ana ma ka puka o ka hale\" is a pahoa standing at the door. \"Ua kukuluia\" might mean it's been placed there or set up.\n\nNext, Keinohoomanawanui speaks: \"Make kaua! Eia la he pahoa ma ka puka o ka hale o kaua! Ua loaa. Aloha ino kaua i ka make; o ka’u no ia e olelo aku ana ia oe e waiho ke ’lii, aohe make olelo.\" So, \"Make kaua\" means let's not die. \"Eia la\" is here, so \"he pahoa ma ka puka o ka hale o kaua\" is a pahoa at our door. \"Ua loaa\" might mean it's present or arrived. \"Aloha ino kaua i ka make\" is we love life, or we don't want to die. \"O ka’u no ia e olelo aku ana ia oe\" is it's me telling you. \"E waiho ke ’lii, aohe make olelo\" might mean to leave the chief, without any death talk.\n\nI need to make sure the translation flows naturally in English. I'll structure it into two paragraphs: the first describing their actions and finding the pahoa, and the second being Keinohoomanawanui's speech. I'll also ensure that the names are correctly transliterated and that the cultural context is maintained.\n\nI should check if \"pahoa\" has a specific meaning beyond just a fish, maybe a type of fish or a term with cultural significance. Also, \"ke ’lii\" likely refers to a chief or leader, so I'll translate that accordingly.\n\nPutting it all together, I'll make sure the translation is accurate and conveys the same message as the original Hawaiian text.\n</think>\n\n<translation>\nKalelealuaku and Keinohoomanawanui were awoken in the morning and went outside of their house. When they went down, they found a pahoa standing at the door, which had been placed there. Keinohoomanawanui then said to Kalelealuaka, \"Let us not die! Here is a pahoa at the door of our house! It has been placed there. We love life and do not wish to die; it is I who am telling you to leave the chief, without any talk of death.\"\n</translation>",
  "reference_translation": "When Kalelealuaka and Keinohoomanawanui woke up in the morning and went out of doors, they saw a wooden dagger sticking in the ground just outside of the entrance. At seeing this Keinohoomanawanui said to Kalelealuaka: “We are going to be killed. Here is a wooden dagger at our door. We have been discovered. What a pity that we are to be killed. You can now see the consequences of disobeying my advice, not to speak anything in connection with the king.”"
