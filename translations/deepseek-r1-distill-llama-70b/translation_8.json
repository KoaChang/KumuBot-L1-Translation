  "deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b_translation": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to translate this Hawaiian text into English. Let me start by reading through the text carefully to understand the context and the nuances. The text begins with \"Olelo mai na kanaka makua,\" which I think means \"The parent said\" or \"The parents said.\" Then there's a dialogue between a parent and a child, so I need to capture that conversational tone.\n\nThe parent is asking the child about something related to a canoe, using terms like \"waa,\" \"iako,\" and \"ama.\" I remember that in Hawaiian, \"waa\" refers to a canoe, \"iako\" is the lateral support or outrigger, and \"ama\" is the outrigger float. The child responds by explaining each part, using phrases like \"kuku ia ke kapa\" which might mean \"to shape or form the wood.\" \n\nI should make sure to accurately translate each term to maintain the technical accuracy. Also, the repetition in the child's response is important for emphasis, so I need to reflect that in English without making it sound awkward. \n\nI'll start by translating each sentence one by one, ensuring that the structure and meaning are preserved. I'll pay attention to the use of articles and pronouns to keep the dialogue natural. After translating, I'll read through the entire response to make sure it flows smoothly and accurately represents the original Hawaiian text.\n</think>\n\n<translation>\nThe parents said: \"Child, what's wrong? Is the canoe finished inside the house, or is it just the outrigger? The child replied: \"Shaping the wood for the canoe, fitting it inside the house—is that not a canoe? It is a canoe. Shaping the wood for the outrigger, fitting it inside the house—is that not an outrigger? It is an outrigger. Shaping the wood for the float, fitting it inside the house—is that not a float? It is a float.\"\n</translation>",
  "reference_translation": "The men then replied: “You are mistaken, young man. How can a canoe get into a calabash with its iako and outrigger?” The boy answered: “The kapa cloth made from the kiwaawaa is first beaten and then put into the calabash. The word (waa) canoe is there, is it not? I think it is. The kapa of iako is also beaten and then put into the calabash. Is not the iako then put into the calabash? I believe it is. The fisherman goes out and catches an ama and puts it into the calabash. Is not that an ama (outrigger)? I think it is.”"
