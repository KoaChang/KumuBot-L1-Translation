  "deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b_translation": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to translate this Hawaiian text into English. I'm not very familiar with Hawaiian, but I know it's a Polynesian language with a lot of meaning in each word. Let me start by breaking down the text into smaller parts to understand each sentence.\n\nThe first part is \"O Waiakea i Hilo ka aina, o Halepaki ka makuakane, o Wailea ka makuahine.\" I think \"O\" is like \"of\" or \"belonging to.\" So \"Waiakea i Hilo\" might be a place name, maybe \"Waiakea in Hilo.\" \"Ka aina\" probably means \"the land.\" Then \"Halepaki\" is the father, and \"Wailea\" is the mother. So the first sentence is introducing the land and the parents.\n\nNext, \"He kaikaina hoi ko Wailea, o Kalenaihaleauau, ka wahine a Kukuipahu, ke ’lii o Kohala.\" \"He\" might be \"a\" or \"an.\" \"Kaikaina\" could be \"younger sibling\" or \"child.\" \"Ko Wailea\" is possessive, so \"of Wailea.\" \"Kalenaihaleauau\" is a name, maybe the child's name. \"Ka wahine a Kukuipahu\" would be \"the wife of Kukuipahu.\" \"Ke ’lii o Kohala\" is \"the chief of Kohala.\" So this part is talking about the child of Wailea, named Kalenaihaleauau, who is the wife of Kukuipahu, the chief of Kohala.\n\nMoving on, \"Hanau o Kaipalaoa a nui, hele kona makuakane a Kauai, make ia Kalanialiiloa, he ’lii kapu no Kauai, he ’lii akamai i ka hoopapa, nana ua pa iwi nei o kanaka, o Halepaiwi, he wahi iki koe puni loa ua pa nei i ka iwi kanaka.\" \"Hanau\" means \"born,\" so \"Kaipalaoa was born abundantly.\" \"Hele kona makuakane a Kauai\" might be \"his father went to Kauai.\" \"Make ia Kalanialiiloa\" could be \"and Kalanialiiloa died.\" \"He ’lii kapu no Kauai\" is \"a sacred chief of Kauai.\" \"He ’lii akamai i ka hoopapa\" might be \"a wise chief in the hoopapa (maybe a type of vessel or something).\" \"Nana ua pa iwi nei o kanaka\" could be \"look, the bones of the people are scattered.\" \"O Halepaiwi\" is \"of Halepaiwi,\" which might be a place. \"He wahi iki koe puni loa ua pa nei i ka iwi kanaka\" could be \"a small place where many human bones are scattered.\"\n\nThe last part is \"Ua ike no o Halepaki i ka hoopapa, ua ao ia no, aole nae i ailolo, holo e i Kauai a make ai ia Kalanialiiloa.\" \"Ua ike\" is \"knew.\" \"I ka hoopapa\" in the hoopapa. \"Ua ao ia no\" maybe \"he was skilled.\" \"Aole nae i ailolo\" could be \"but he wasn't fooled.\" \"Holo e i Kauai a make ai ia Kalanialiiloa\" might be \"go to Kauai and kill Kalanialiiloa.\"\n\nFinally, \"O Pueonuiokona ke ’lii o Kauai.\" \"O\" again, so \"Pueonuiokona is the chief of Kauai.\"\n\nPutting it all together, it seems to be a story about a family, their origins, and some events involving chiefs and Kauai. I need to make sure the translation is accurate and flows well in English. I might have made some mistakes with the terms, so I should double-check the meanings of words like \"hoopapa\" and \"kapu\" to ensure they're correctly translated. Also, proper nouns like place names and titles should be handled carefully to maintain their significance.\n</think>\n\n<translation>\nWaiakea in Hilo is the land, Halepaki is the father, and Wailea is the mother. Wailea's younger sibling is Kalenaihaleauau, the wife of Kukuipahu, the chief of Kohala. Kaipalaoa was abundantly born, his father went to Kauai, and Kalanialiiloa died, a sacred chief of Kauai, a wise chief in the hoopapa</translation>",
  "reference_translation": "Kaipalaoa was born in Waiakea, Hilo. His father was Halepaki and his mother was Wailea the sister of Kalenaihaleauau, the wife of Kukuipahu, the king of Kohala. After Kaipalaoa was grown up his father went off to Kauai where he was killed by Kalanialiiloa, a kapu chief of Kauai. This chief was in the front rank of those who took up the profession of hoopapa, who by reason of his great skill had his house enclosed in a fence of bones. This fence was almost completed and every bone in it had come from those he had defeated in the profession."
