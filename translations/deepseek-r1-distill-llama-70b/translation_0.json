  "deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b_translation": "<think>\nAlright, so the user has given me a query where they want to translate some Hawaiian text into English. They also specified to wrap the translation in <translation> tags. Let me start by understanding the task.\n\nFirst, I need to read the Hawaiian text carefully. It's about Kana, describing his body as very tall and large, and his house Halauoloolo. The text mentions that his body was so tall it reached from the mountain to the sea, and the house was similarly tall.\n\nI should break down the translation step by step. I'll start by parsing each sentence. \"Ma keia kaao ana\" seems to be introducing the story. Then \"ua olelo ia ke kino o Kana\" translates to \"it is said that Kana's body...\" The adjectives \"loihi loa\" mean very tall, and \"nui a weliweli ke nana aku\" would be \"large and terrifying to look upon.\"\n\nNext, \"I kona hanai ia ana\" refers to his height during his upbringing. \"Ua panee kona kino i ka loihi\" means his body was tall. Then, \"a ua panee no hoi kona hale o Halauoloolo\" adds that his house was also tall. The last part describes the extent of his height: from the mountain to the sea, and similarly for the house.\n\nI need to ensure the translation is accurate and maintains the poetic feel of the original text. Also, I should use the correct grammatical structure in English to convey the same meaning without making it sound too literal.\n\nAfter translating each part, I'll compile the sentences into a coherent paragraph and wrap it with the specified tags. I should double-check for any possible errors or awkward phrasing to make sure the translation is smooth and understandable.\n\nFinally, I'll present the translation as per the user's instructions, making sure it's properly formatted and enclosed within the <translation> tags.\n</think>\n\n<translation>In this story, it is said that Kana's body was very tall, a large and terrifying sight to behold. During his upbringing, his body was so tall that it reached the heavens, and likewise, his house, Halauoloolo, was so tall that it seemed to touch the sky. From the mountain to the sea, his tall stature was like the reach of his house, Halauoloolo.</translation>",
  "reference_translation": "In this legend it is said that the body of Kana grew to be very tall and large and was terrible to behold. While he was being brought up, he grew so fast that the house had to be lengthened, so that it extended from the mountain until it was almost to the edge of the sea. Such is the story as told of this house, Halauoloolo."
