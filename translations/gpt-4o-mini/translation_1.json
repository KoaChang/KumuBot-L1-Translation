  "gpt-4o-mini_translation": "<translation>Due to the extreme hunger of Pikoiakaalala, he strayed away from the gathering of people and returned until he reached his sisters, where a pig was roasted and food was prepared. Before the meal, Pikoiakaalala responded: “Listen all of you, I have a law regarding eating, as follows: ‘No talking, no whispering, no poking, no sneezing, no spitting, all of my meal.’” He took the pig, one piece, of the sweet potato poi, one serving, and then, taking again, he was close to finishing the whole pig, along with all the food from the oven. One person replied: “It is food from God.” This was cut off. The relatives responded: “What is the reason for cutting off the food?” “No, he is already full.” “Yes, we have also heard your law,” said the relatives. While eating like this, Pikoiakaalala's body grew and he became a great and handsome man, but his hair was like that of a rat.</translation>",
  "reference_translation": "As Pikoiakaalala was very hungry he disappeared from the people who had gathered at this place and returned to his sisters, where he found the pig and food cooked. Before he sat down to eat Pikoiakaalala addressed the people, saying: “I want you all to understand that I have certain rules in connection with my meals. There must be no talking, no whispering, no nodding, no pinching and no noise of any kind should be heard until I finish my meal.” He then reached for a piece of pork and a dish of potato, taking one bite of each which he swallowed; he then reached for another piece of pork, almost finishing the pig, and all the food of the oven. At this one of the men remarked: “He eats like a god.” On hearing this Pikoiakaalala stopped eating. His brothers-in-law then said: “Why don’t you go on eating?” “No, I have had enough.” “Yes, we already heard your rule,” said his brother-in-law. In this one meal partaken by Pikoiakaalala, he grew into a large and fine looking man, but his hair was [like] rat’s hair."
