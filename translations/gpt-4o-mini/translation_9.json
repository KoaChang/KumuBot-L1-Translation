Wailea also has a younger sister, Kalenaihaleauau, the wife of Kukuipahu, the chief of Kohala. Born of Kaipalaoa, her father went to Kauai, where Kalanialiiloa died, a sacred chief of Kauai, a wise chief in governance, who oversaw the bones of the people, of Halepaiwi, a small place that is entirely surrounded by the bones of people. Halepaki knew of the governance, was taught it, but did not escape, fleeing to Kauai where Kalanialiiloa died. Pueonuiokona is the chief of Kauai.</translation>",
  "reference_translation": "Kaipalaoa was born in Waiakea, Hilo. His father was Halepaki and his mother was Wailea the sister of Kalenaihaleauau, the wife of Kukuipahu, the king of Kohala. After Kaipalaoa was grown up his father went off to Kauai where he was killed by Kalanialiiloa, a kapu chief of Kauai. This chief was in the front rank of those who took up the profession of hoopapa, who by reason of his great skill had his house enclosed in a fence of bones. This fence was almost completed and every bone in it had come from those he had defeated in the profession."
