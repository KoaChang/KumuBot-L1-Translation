  "gpt-4o-mini_translation": "<translation>On the second day of their journey in Hilo, Keawenuiaumi and Mainele climbed to a place of the canoe, and the birds were calling, with the sound of the canoe's paddle. When they reached the base of that tree, Kauakahi was sitting apart with the paddle. At that time, Keawenuiaumi's canoe was stuck at the base of the tree, and the birds were perched, calling out: \"Oh, Keawenuiaumi! There is no canoe, it is stuck. It is a bad canoe, a stuck canoe. It cannot go to the sea.\"</translation>",
  "reference_translation": "On the second day of their arrival at Hilo, Keawenuiaumi, Mainele and the people proceeded up into the koa forest where the tree that had been already picked out was situated. On this trip the basket was carried along, and when they arrived at the tree, Kauakahi and his basket remained at a little distance from the others. The king’s canoe makers then proceeded to cut down the tree. Just as soon as this was done the birds lit on the tree and called out: “Say, Keawenuiaumi! You cannot make a canoe [out of this tree], it is hollow. It is a worthless canoe, a hollow canoe. A canoe that will never reach the ocean.”"
