During his childhood, his body was as long as the house of Halauoloolo, from the mountain to the sea his long body stretched, and that's how long the house of Halauoloolo was.</translation>",
  "reference_translation": "In this legend it is said that the body of Kana grew to be very tall and large and was terrible to behold. While he was being brought up, he grew so fast that the house had to be lengthened, so that it extended from the mountain until it was almost to the edge of the sea. Such is the story as told of this house, Halauoloolo."
