  "llama-3.3_translation": "<translation>In the calm of their day in Hilo, Keawenuiaumi and Mainele went to the canoe shed, and the birds were calling, with the sound of the paddles. And when they arrived under the tree of this canoe, Kauakahi was sitting apart with the paddles. At that time, Keawenuiaumi's canoe builders were at the base of the canoe, holding the birds, calling out: \"Oh, Keawenuiaumi! There's no canoe, it's a bundle. It's a bad canoe, a bundle canoe. It's a canoe that can't go out to sea.\"</translation>",
  "reference_translation": "On the second day of their arrival at Hilo, Keawenuiaumi, Mainele and the people proceeded up into the koa forest where the tree that had been already picked out was situated. On this trip the basket was carried along, and when they arrived at the tree, Kauakahi and his basket remained at a little distance from the others. The king’s canoe makers then proceeded to cut down the tree. Just as soon as this was done the birds lit on the tree and called out: “Say, Keawenuiaumi! You cannot make a canoe [out of this tree], it is hollow. It is a worthless canoe, a hollow canoe. A canoe that will never reach the ocean.”"
