  "llama-3.3_translation": "<translation>\nKalelealuaka and Keinohoomanawanui, as they went out of their house in the morning, saw a pahoa (a type of Hawaiian spear) standing at the door of the house, which had been erected. Keinohoomanawanui said to Kalelealuaka: \"We will die! There is a pahoa at the door of our house! It has been found. We love life; I am telling you to leave the chief, there is no death spoken.\"\n</translation>",
  "reference_translation": "When Kalelealuaka and Keinohoomanawanui woke up in the morning and went out of doors, they saw a wooden dagger sticking in the ground just outside of the entrance. At seeing this Keinohoomanawanui said to Kalelealuaka: “We are going to be killed. Here is a wooden dagger at our door. We have been discovered. What a pity that we are to be killed. You can now see the consequences of disobeying my advice, not to speak anything in connection with the king.”"
