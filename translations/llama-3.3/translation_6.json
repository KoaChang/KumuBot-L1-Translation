  "llama-3.3_translation": "<translation>\nMakiioeoe was the father, and Hina was the mother (Kuaihelani was Makiioeoe's land, and she was the chief there, a woman who lived in Kuaihelani, and she had one child with that woman, whose name was Kahikiula). Hina was from Kauai, where Laukiamanuikahiki was found. Makiioeoe came from Kuaihelani, and when he arrived in Kauai, he met Hina, and they slept together; and soon, Hina was pregnant. At that time, Makiioeoe returned to Kuaihelani and told Hina: \"I am going; you stay and when you give birth to a boy, name him after me; and if you give birth to a girl, name her after Laukiamanuikahiki. When the child grows up and thinks of coming to find me, here are the signs: a palaoa necklace, a kupee (a type of shell), an ahuula (a type of feather cloak), a large canoe, a small canoe, a large man, a small man, a red canoe, a red shell, a red feather cloak, a red fish, and a red man.\" And so Makiioeoe returned to Kuaihelani, with the instruction that if the child was a girl, everything would be done according to the customs for Laukiamanuikahiki, and all the things that were forbidden and allowed would be observed, and all would be kapu (forbidden) and noa (free) for Laukiamanuikahiki.\n</translation>",
  "reference_translation": "Makiioeoe was the father and Hina was the mother of Laukiamanuikahiki. Kuaihelani was the home of Makiioeoe where he ruled as king and where his queen lived from whom he had one child, Kahikiula by name. Hina belonged to Kauai, where Laukiamanuikahiki was born. Makiioeoe in his travels came to Kauai where he met Hina and took her to wife, and after living with her for some time, Hina conceived a child. Shortly after this Makiioeoe prepared to return to Kuaihelani; so he said to Hina: “I am going home. If you should give birth to a boy give him my name; but in case it should be a girl call her Laukiamanuikahiki. If after you bring the child up she should express a desire to come in search of me, these shall be the tokens by which I shall recognize the child: this necklace of whale’s teeth, this bracelet, this feather cloak. She must be accompanied by a large canoe, a small canoe, large men, small men, a red canoe, red sails, red bailing cup, red cords and a red man.” Makiioeoe then took his leave and returned to Kuaihelani. When he arrived home he instructed his guards as to the sign by which to recognize his daughter and he also instructed his servants to proceed and plant all kinds of fruit and other things for his daughter Laukiamanuikahiki. He also caused a pool of water to be made as well as other things and placed a kapu on them all to be free only after the same shall have been used by Laukiamanuikahiki."
