It is a canoe. If we take the sail and turn it upside down, isn't that the sail? It is a sail. If we take the fishhook and turn it upside down, isn't that the outrigger? It is an outrigger.</translation>",
  "reference_translation": "The men then replied: “You are mistaken, young man. How can a canoe get into a calabash with its iako and outrigger?” The boy answered: “The kapa cloth made from the kiwaawaa is first beaten and then put into the calabash. The word (waa) canoe is there, is it not? I think it is. The kapa of iako is also beaten and then put into the calabash. Is not the iako then put into the calabash? I believe it is. The fisherman goes out and catches an ama and puts it into the calabash. Is not that an ama (outrigger)? I think it is.”"
