  "gpt-4.5-preview_translation": "<translation>\nBecause Pikoiakaalala was extremely hungry, he disappeared from the crowd of people and returned to his sisters, where the pig and food had already been cooked. Before eating, Pikoiakaalala said: \"Listen carefully, all of you, I have one rule for eating, as follows: 'No talking, no whispering, no bowing, no pinching, no murmuring, until I have finished my meal.'\" He then grabbed the pig, took one bite, took one swallow of sweet potato poi, swallowed, grabbed again, and nearly finished the entire pig and all the food from the oven. One person remarked: \"This is food fit for a god.\" At this, Pikoiakaalala stopped eating. His in-laws asked: \"Why have you stopped eating?\" He replied, \"No, I am already satisfied.\" \"Indeed, we heard your rule,\" said the in-laws. Because of this meal, Pikoiakaalala's body grew large and handsome, although his hair remained like that of a rat.\n</translation>",
  "reference_translation": "As Pikoiakaalala was very hungry he disappeared from the people who had gathered at this place and returned to his sisters, where he found the pig and food cooked. Before he sat down to eat Pikoiakaalala addressed the people, saying: “I want you all to understand that I have certain rules in connection with my meals. There must be no talking, no whispering, no nodding, no pinching and no noise of any kind should be heard until I finish my meal.” He then reached for a piece of pork and a dish of potato, taking one bite of each which he swallowed; he then reached for another piece of pork, almost finishing the pig, and all the food of the oven. At this one of the men remarked: “He eats like a god.” On hearing this Pikoiakaalala stopped eating. His brothers-in-law then said: “Why don’t you go on eating?” “No, I have had enough.” “Yes, we already heard your rule,” said his brother-in-law. In this one meal partaken by Pikoiakaalala, he grew into a large and fine looking man, but his hair was [like] rat’s hair."
