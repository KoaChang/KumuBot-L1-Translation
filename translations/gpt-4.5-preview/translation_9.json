  "gpt-4.5-preview_translation": "<translation>\nWaiakea in Hilo was the land, Halepaki was the father, and Wailea was the mother. Wailea also had a younger sibling named Kalenaihaleauau, the wife of Kukuipahu, the chief of Kohala. Kaipalaoa was born and grew up. His father traveled to Kauai and died because of Kalanialiiloa, a sacred chief of Kauai, who was skilled in debate. He was the one who built the bone enclosure of human remains, Halepaiwi, a place almost entirely surrounded by human bones. Halepaki was knowledgeable in debate, having been taught, but he had not completed the ailolo ceremony. He traveled to Kauai and was killed by Kalanialiiloa. Pueonuiokona was the chief of Kauai.\n</translation>",
  "reference_translation": "Kaipalaoa was born in Waiakea, Hilo. His father was Halepaki and his mother was Wailea the sister of Kalenaihaleauau, the wife of Kukuipahu, the king of Kohala. After Kaipalaoa was grown up his father went off to Kauai where he was killed by Kalanialiiloa, a kapu chief of Kauai. This chief was in the front rank of those who took up the profession of hoopapa, who by reason of his great skill had his house enclosed in a fence of bones. This fence was almost completed and every bone in it had come from those he had defeated in the profession."
