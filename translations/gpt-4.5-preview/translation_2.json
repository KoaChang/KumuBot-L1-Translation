Keinohoomanawanui said to Kalelealuaka: \"We are doomed! Here is a dagger at the doorway of our house! We have been discovered. Alas, we are destined to die; this is exactly what I warned you about when I told you to leave the chief alone, but you did not heed my words.\"\n</translation>",
  "reference_translation": "When Kalelealuaka and Keinohoomanawanui woke up in the morning and went out of doors, they saw a wooden dagger sticking in the ground just outside of the entrance. At seeing this Keinohoomanawanui said to Kalelealuaka: “We are going to be killed. Here is a wooden dagger at our door. We have been discovered. What a pity that we are to be killed. You can now see the consequences of disobeying my advice, not to speak anything in connection with the king.”"
