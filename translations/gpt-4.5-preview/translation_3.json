  "gpt-4.5-preview_translation": "<translation>\nOn their second day in Hilo, Keawenuiaumi and Mainele climbed up to the place of the canoe koa tree, where the birds called out, carrying with them the basket of fish. When they arrived directly beneath the koa tree, Kauakahi sat apart with the basket of fish. At that moment, the canoe carvers of Keawenuiaumi began cutting down the koa tree, and the birds perched above called out: \"Oh, Keawenuiaumi! This is no canoe, it is hollow. A bad canoe, a hollow canoe. A canoe that cannot sail upon the ocean.\"\n</translation>",
  "reference_translation": "On the second day of their arrival at Hilo, Keawenuiaumi, Mainele and the people proceeded up into the koa forest where the tree that had been already picked out was situated. On this trip the basket was carried along, and when they arrived at the tree, Kauakahi and his basket remained at a little distance from the others. The king’s canoe makers then proceeded to cut down the tree. Just as soon as this was done the birds lit on the tree and called out: “Say, Keawenuiaumi! You cannot make a canoe [out of this tree], it is hollow. It is a worthless canoe, a hollow canoe. A canoe that will never reach the ocean.”"
